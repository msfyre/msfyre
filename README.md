    I'm a 16 year old student in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) curriculum residing in the hellhole known as the country of the Philippines (unfortunately 🥀🥀🥀).

    I have started programming at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year 2020 when the whole world goes to a full lockdown because of it.
    The first ever language I have programmed in was in Scratch in an account before this account was made.
